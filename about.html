    <h1>About Odin Recipes</h1>

    This is going to be a recipe website.<br />
    <br />
    It'll be brutalist web design. It will not be pretty!<br />
    <br />
    You want pretty? Well we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.<br />
    <br />
    Until then, its important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops.<br />
    <br />
    There will be no recipes involving chops.<br />
